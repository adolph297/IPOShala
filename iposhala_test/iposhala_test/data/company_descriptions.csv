SREIBNPNCD,Srei Equipment Finance Limited,"The investor can apply for the NCD IPO online through NCD intermediaries such as a registered stockbroker, provided the broker offers an online application for the NCD IPO. Not many brokers allow you to invest in an NCD IPO online. Currently, very few brokers, such as Nuvama Wealth , Angel One, and SBI Securities, offer the facility to apply for NCD IPOs electronically. You should check with your broker or intermediary to see if the online application facility for the NCD IPO is available through them. As of September 30, 2018, Srei has partnerships with 270 OEMs. The company offers its products to a wide range of customers, from 'First Time Users' ('FTUs') and 'First Time Buyers' ('FTBs') to fleet owners, mid-size contractors, corporations and project owners. It has a presence in 21 states through 90 branches and 4 offices including the head office in Kolkata."
